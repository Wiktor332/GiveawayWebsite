  "description": "Website built around API and Python script which i wrote to pull JSON data about available free games and DLC. The tech stack include **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **Python**, **REST API** and **Node.js**. Used node.js to run python script responsible for pulling data from API, every 22 hours, while server is live. Utilized **GIT** for version control which was very important because i work on two separate devices. This project similar to the other, was entirely conceived by me, and i handled both webiste's design and technical aspects from inception to completion.\r This website is compatible with mobile device screens. I am still actively introducing new ideas to this project.\r [Live demo](https://wiktor332.github.io/GiveawayWebsite/index_main.html)",
