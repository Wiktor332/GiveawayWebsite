# GiveawayWebsite
Website built around API and Python script which i wrote to pull JSON data about available free games and DLC. The tech stack include **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **Python**, **REST API**. Automated the process of pulling the data from API with **GitHub Actions**. Every 22hours the **githubactions-bot** runs the script so there is no need to do this manually. Utilized **GIT** for version control which was very important because i work on two separate devices. This project similar to the other, was entirely conceived by me, and i handled both webiste's design and technical aspects from inception to completion.
This website is compatible with mobile device screens. I am still actively introducing new ideas to this project.
