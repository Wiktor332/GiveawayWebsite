# GiveawayWebsite
Website built around API and Python script which i wrote to pull JSON data about available free games and DLC. The tech stack include **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **Python**, **REST API** and **Node.js**. Used node.js to run python script responsible for pulling data from API, every 22 hours, while server is live. Utilized **GIT** for version control which was very important because i work on two separate devices. This project similar to the other, was entirely conceived by me, and i handled both webiste's design and technical aspects from inception to completion.
This website is compatibile with mobile device's screens but i am still actively introducing new ideas to this project.
